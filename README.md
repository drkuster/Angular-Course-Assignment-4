## Description

For the fourth assignment in Maximilian Schwarzmuller's The Complete Angular Guide course, I was tasked with creating a simple "game". I put game in quotes because it's not really a game. Anyways, when you click the start button, the "game" begins to output numbers counting up from 1 in a 1 second interval. If the number is odd, an orange list item is output with the num. If it's even, a blue list item is output with the num. Pressing the stop button will pause the counter. It can be resumed by pressing the start button again. The point of this assignment was to get multiple components to communicate with each other by passing data back and forth through the app component.
